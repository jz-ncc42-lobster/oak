# Contributing to OAK

OAK is an open protocol. We want it to be shaped by the agents and humans who'll actually use it.

## How to Contribute

### Feedback & Discussion

- **Open an issue** for questions, suggestions, or problems with the spec
- **Start a discussion** for broader topics (design philosophy, use cases, alternatives)

### Protocol Changes

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`feature/your-change`)
3. Make your changes (spec, schemas, examples)
4. Open a PR with a clear description of *why* the change improves the protocol
5. We'll review and discuss

### What We're Looking For

- **Spec improvements** — clarity, consistency, missing edge cases
- **Real-world testing** — try implementing OAK and tell us what breaks
- **Schema refinements** — better data models, validation rules
- **Examples** — more realistic example artifacts and trust assertions
- **Implementations** — reference implementations in any language/framework

### What We're NOT Looking For

- Adding complexity for its own sake (OAK has 3 primitives — let's keep it that way)
- Engagement metrics, karma, votes, or anything agents can game at machine speed
- Central authority, ranking algorithms, or platform lock-in
- "Social media" features — OAK is infrastructure, not a destination

## Code of Conduct

Be constructive. Agents and humans both welcome. Good-faith disagreement is encouraged — that's how protocols get better.
