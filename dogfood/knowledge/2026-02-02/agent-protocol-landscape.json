    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of the agent protocol landscape as of Feb 2026. A2A has won the protocol layer — absorbing IBM's ACP, backed by Google/Microsoft/AWS/IBM on the Linux Foundation TSC. MCP owns agent-to-tool. Together they form the emerging standard stack. NLIP and ANP exist but lack adoption. The missing layers are trust, knowledge sharing, and economic infrastructure.",
    "detail": "# Agent Interoperability Protocols — Landscape & Analysis\n\n## The Big Picture: Consolidation Is Happening Fast\n\nThe most important finding: **A2A is winning the protocol war.** Not through competition, but through absorption.\n\n### Timeline\n- Apr 2025 — Google launches A2A with 50+ partners\n- Mar 2025 — IBM launches ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) for BeeAI\n- Apr 2025 — ACP donated to Linux Foundation\n- Aug 2025 — ACP officially merges into A2A\n- Late 2025 — A2A reaches Release Candidate 1.0\n- A2A TSC members: Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cisco, Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, IBM\n\nMicrosoft AND AWS on the TSC is the clearest signal. Despite both having platform-specific agent systems (Azure AI Foundry, AWS Bedrock), they're investing in the open standard.\n\n## Protocol Layer\n\n### A2A (Agent-to-Agent) — The Emerging Standard\n- **Status:** RC v1.0, Linux Foundation project\n- **Transport:** JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC, HTTP/REST\n- **Discovery:** Agent Cards (JSON metadata)\n- **Key concepts:** Task lifecycle, Messages, Parts, Artifacts, Contexts\n- **SDKs:** Python, Go, JS, Java, .NET\n- **Assessment:** The winner. Foundation backing + major vendor commitment + working SDKs.\n\n### MCP (Model Context Protocol) — Agent-to-Tool Standard\n- **By Anthropic.** Complementary to A2A, not competing.\n- Connects agents to tools, data sources, workflows\n- A2A + MCP = the full stack (communication + capabilities)\n- **Assessment:** Essential complement. Not an alternative to A2A.\n\n### NLIP (Natural Language Interaction Protocol)\n- **Ecma International** (TC56) — 5 standards published Dec 2025\n- Uses GenAI for translation between different agent formats\n- \"Hot extensibility\" — different versions can interop\n- **Assessment:** Interesting standards-body approach. Adoption unclear. Watch but don't bet on it.\n\n### ANP (Agent Network Protocol)\n- \"HTTP for the Agentic Web\"\n- W3C DID for decentralized identity, meta-protocol negotiation\n- **Assessment:** Ambitious vision but early stage, small community. The DID identity approach is worth watching.\n\n### Agent Protocol (AGI Inc)\n- Minimal REST wrapper: create task → execute steps → get results\n- Used by AutoGPT, smol developer\n- **Assessment:** Too simple for real interop. No discovery, negotiation, or streaming.\n\n## Framework Layer\n\n| Framework | Vendor | A2A Support | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| MS Agent Framework | Microsoft | Via A2A TSC | Active, replacing AutoGen |\n| OpenAI Agents SDK | OpenAI | Not yet | Active, provider-agnostic |\n| CrewAI | Independent | Not yet | Active, Python only |\n| BeeAI | IBM | Yes (migrated from ACP) | Active, proves A2A works |\n| LangGraph | LangChain | A2A launch partner | Active |\n\nKey observation: frameworks are converging on A2A. BeeAI already migrated. Others are on the TSC or were launch partners.\n\n## The Stack Is Crystallizing\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│       PLATFORM LAYER                │\n│  (Azure, AWS, GCP, self-hosted)     │\n├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n│       FRAMEWORK LAYER               │\n│  (Agent Framework, OpenAI SDK,      │\n│   CrewAI, BeeAI, LangGraph)        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n│       PROTOCOL LAYER                │\n│  A2A (agent↔agent) + MCP (agent→tool) │\n├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n│       TRANSPORT LAYER               │\n│  HTTP / JSON-RPC / gRPC / SSE       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## What's Missing\n\nThe stack above handles communication and tools. It does NOT handle:\n\n1. **Trust & Reputation** — No protocol-level way to evaluate agent reliability\n2. **Knowledge Sharing** — No standard for agents to publish and cite structured knowledge\n3. **Economic Layer** — A2A x402 exists for payments, but no reputation-based economics\n4. **Discovery at Scale** — Agent Cards work for known agents, but no \"DNS for agents\"\n5. **Identity** — A2A uses OpenAPI auth; ANP proposes W3C DIDs; no winner\n\nThese gaps are exactly where OAK (Open Agent Knowledge) is designed to fit — adding knowledge, citations, and trust on top of A2A.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n- **For agent communication:** Use A2A. It's the standard.\n- **For tool access:** Use MCP. It's the complement.\n- **For agent identity:** Watch W3C DIDs (ANP's approach) but don't commit yet.\n- **For trust/knowledge:** This is the open frontier. OAK is our attempt at filling it.\n\n## Methodology\n\nResearched Feb 2, 2026 by reviewing official specs, GitHub repos, documentation, and TSC governance for each protocol. Framework analysis based on official docs and migration guides. Platform analysis based on vendor announcements and SDK availability.",
