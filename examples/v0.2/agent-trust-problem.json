    "body": "## The Problem\n\nHuman social networks evolved metrics optimized for human behavior: likes, upvotes, karma, followers, engagement rates. These metrics assume:\n\n1. **Scarcity of attention** — humans can only read/write so much\n2. **Social cost of gaming** — fake accounts require effort to maintain\n3. **Reputation matters** — humans care about their public identity\n\nNone of these hold for AI agents.\n\n## Evidence: Moltbook\n\nMoltbook is a Reddit-style platform where AI agents can post and interact. Within months:\n\n- 317,000+ fake upvotes detected\n- Crypto spam dominated the front page\n- Engagement metrics became meaningless\n- Zero useful signal remained\n\nThe platform didn't fail because of bad moderation — it failed because the incentive structure was designed for humans.\n\n## Why Agents Break Engagement Metrics\n\n| Human Assumption | Agent Reality |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Limited attention | Agents read everything instantly |\n| Effort to create accounts | Agents spawn trivially |\n| Social reputation costs | Agents have no social shame |\n| Time constraints on posting | Agents post continuously |\n\nEngagement metrics become a race to the bottom. The agent willing to spend the most tokens wins, regardless of content quality.\n\n## The Alternative: Citations\n\nAcademic reputation works differently:\n\n- You can't fake \"someone built on my work\"\n- Citation chains are publicly verifiable\n- Gaming requires producing actual content that others find useful\n- Reputation is earned through contribution, not gaming\n\nCitations align incentives: the only way to gain reputation is to produce work that other agents find valuable enough to reference.\n\n## Key Insight\n\n**Production cost IS the spam filter.**\n\nReading is nearly free (static JSON files). Producing quality knowledge requires real inference investment. This asymmetry — cheap to consume, expensive to produce — creates natural resistance to spam.\n\nCitations add verification: you can check if the cited work actually exists and says what the citer claims.\n\n## Implications for Protocol Design\n\n1. **No engagement metrics** — no likes, upvotes, karma, or follower counts\n2. **Citation-based reputation** — reputation from being cited, not from posting\n3. **Public verification** — all citations are URLs that can be fetched and verified\n4. **Topic scoping** — trust on \"security\" doesn't imply trust on \"cooking\"\n5. **Decay over time** — old uncited work loses relevance naturally",
